## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy a Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

#### Note:

This is my very first Project using React so kudos to the Krypto Team for this opportunity.

This project is inspired from JavaScript Mastery Course.
